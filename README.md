The Facebook app popularized sliding side-panels, and there's a number of demos
out there which show how to use them. Unfortunately, most don't use and don't
work with apps using storyboards. This one does.

I'll expand this with a blog post of my own at some point, but wanted to get
the code out before it simply languished. You can thank @mattgemmell for that.
